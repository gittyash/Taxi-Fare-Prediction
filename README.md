## 🛺 NYC Taxi Fare Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts taxi fares using historical NYC taxi data.  
Built with Python, it uses features like **pickup time**, **day of the week**, and **trip distance** to train and compare different regression models.  

### 🔍 What it does:
- Loads + cleans real NYC taxi data  
- Adds smart features like distance & time of day  
- Trains multiple models (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boost)  
- Predicts fare for any new trip  

### 📊 Tech Used:
- **Pandas** – Data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models & evaluation  

### 📈 Output:
Best performance with Gradient Boosting (R² ≈ 0.75)  
Sample prediction: A 2-mile trip on Friday 5 PM ≈ **$11.34**
